# Garmin Repeater Import
I am making a tool to import repeater information from
RepeaterBook.com to my Garmin GPSMAP 66sr. I intend to use the KML format to
transfer the location information, and a custom CSV schema to transfer all the
repeater information. I would also like to use custom icons in my garmin to
denote the type of repeater but that is will not be added until the end.


## How to use the tool
1. Place a single waypoint in Google Earth, export it into kml.
2. Run script to find repeaters then filter the results, save to csv.
3. Run script to import to kml.
4. Open in Google Earth, tidy if needed.
5. Import to Garmin via Basecamp. (Put on sd card and figure out how to use a
   new collection)
